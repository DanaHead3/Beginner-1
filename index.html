            <p>And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as
                a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten
                o’clock, when the shops were closed the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of
                London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were
                clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded
                him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light
                footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint
                effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring
                out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so
                sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he
                withdrew into the entry of the court.</p>

            <p>The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street. The
                lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was
                small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against
                the watcher’s inclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as
                he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.</p>

            <p>Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed. “Mr. Hyde, I think?”</p>

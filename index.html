            <h1>DR. JEKYLL WAS
                QUITE AT EASE</h1>
            <p>A FORTNIGHT later, by excellent good fortune, the
                doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six
                old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of
                good wine; and Mr. Utterson so contrived that he remained
                behind after the others had departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of
                times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts </p>
            
                <p>loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and
                    the loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold;
                    they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man’s rich
                    silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule,
                    Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire — a large, well-made, smooth-faced
                    man of fifty, with something of a slyish cast perhaps, but
                    every mark of capacity and kindness — you could see by
                    his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson a sincere and
                    warm affection.</p>

            <p>‘I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,’ began the
                latter. ‘You know that will of yours?’
                A close observer might have gathered that the topic was
                distasteful; but the doctor carried it off gaily. ‘My poor Utterson,’ said he, ‘you are unfortunate in such a client. I never
                saw a man so distressed as you were by my will; unless it
                were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at what he called
                my scientific heresies. Oh, I know he’s a good fellow — you
                needn’t frown — an excellent fellow, and I always mean to
                see more of him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an
                ignorant, blatant pedant. I was never more disappointed in
                any man than Lanyon.’</p>

            <p>‘You know I never approved of it,’ pursued Utterson,
                ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic.
                ‘My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,’ said the doctor, a
                trifle sharply. ‘You have told me so.’
                ‘Well, I tell you so again,’ continued the lawyer. ‘I have
                been learning something of young Hyde.’
                The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the
                very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. ‘I do
                not care to hear more,’ said he. ‘This is a matter I thought
                we had agreed to drop.’</p>

            <p>‘What I heard was abominable,’ said Utterson.
                ‘It can make no change. You do not understand my position,’ returned the doctor, with a certain
                incoherency of manner. ‘I am painfully situated, Utterson;
                my position is a very strange — a very strange one. It is one
                of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.’
                ‘Jekyll,’ said Utterson, ‘you know me: I am a man to be
                trusted. Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it.’</p>

            <p>‘My good Utterson,’ said the doctor, ‘this is very good of
                you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before
                any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice;
                but indeed it isn’t what you fancy; it is not so bad as that;
                and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one
                thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give
                you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again;
                and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure
                you’ll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of
                you to let it sleep.’</p>
